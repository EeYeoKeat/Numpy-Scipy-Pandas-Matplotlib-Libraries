# Python Libraries Simple Note & Codes

The tutorials mainly used for provide free basic training python class for secondary school student learning purpose.

There are various useful python libraries that built to convenient data handling and processing.


## Common Libraries

## Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python and it able to handle a powerful N-dimensional array object.

The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which we can do various operations.

The key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix. That means we can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

## Pandas

Pandas is useful in data manipulation and analysis, and most common case used in daily is read csv raw data file into table format. Pandas can be considered as necessary library to used in data analysis with Python.


## Matplotlip

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy
In this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.
We’ll also look at how to show images using Matplotlib. <br>

## Seaborn
Seaborn is considered as enhanced version Matplotlib which provide high-level interface for visualize data with more attractive and informative.
