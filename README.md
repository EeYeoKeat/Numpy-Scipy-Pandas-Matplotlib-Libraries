# Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python and it able to handle a powerful N-dimensional array object.

The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which we can do various operations.

The key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix. That means we can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

# Pandas


# Matplotlip

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy
In this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.
